# vm-pci
A library of PCI and PCI Express architecture to implement PCI buses and PCI devices for virtual machine.

PCI/PCIe is mostly used architecture for hypervisor and VMM. The `vm-pci` crate provides a set of traits to describe common PCI/PCIe devices and buses behaviours. Based on these traits, VMM can define or add their device and bus instances as requested, and use `vm-device` trait to manage these instances.

This library has dependency of vm-device library which is a high level virtual machine device model crate.

## Example
- Create a PCIe bus as the first bus (bus 0) in the topology.
```


```

- Create a Dummy device under the PCIe bus (bus 0).
```

```
